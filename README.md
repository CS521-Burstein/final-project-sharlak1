We started by loading the dataset into our environment using pandas and storing it in a dataframe. 
<br/>
Furthermore, we are going to do exploratory analysis and make visualizations to build understanding of our data and importance of different variables. Also, we will study relationship between variables (correlation) in the second deliverable
We started by reading the dataset and storing it in a dataframe using pandas. We found out that there exists various NaN values in our data. Our response variable is going to be Sale Price, so we removed the rows that had NaN values for sale price whereas we converted NaN values of variables with 0 and none, depending upon the nominal and ordinal features which would later be used for dummifying our categorical variables to use it for regression model. 

Also, we built visualizations by forming KPI's and generated useful insights. 

Further, we would use some machine learning algorithms such as k-means clustering, linear regression for prediction etc.
We saw there are 1460 properties wherein we had sale price without any outliers and NaN values from which NAmes had the highest sale price (either we can say most populated area or most expensive area)
